## Introducing Zedata Block

A revolutionary format that makes traditional Metadata Blocks obsolete. Designed for speed and efficiency.

**Traditional Metadata Block (317 bytes):**
```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Hello World Script
// @namespace    zedmonkey
// @version      1.0.0
// @description  Hello World!
// @author       Zedmonkey User
// @match        *://*/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==
```

**Zedmonkey Zedata Block (131 bytes):**
```
script,HelloWorldScript,zedmonkey,1.0.0,HelloWorld,ZedmonkeyUser,*,none
```

**58.65% Size Reduction** - Less data to transfer and store  
**70-80% Faster Parsing** - Simple comma-based format vs line-by-line parsing  
**~40% Memory Reduction** - More compact structure means less RAM usage
